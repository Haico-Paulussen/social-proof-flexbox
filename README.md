## Overview

### The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this social proof section and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned
This time I really focussed on CSS Flexbox. I think it worked out really well. After some tutorials it was a great challenge to practice my Flexbox skills. 

```css
.section-card {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    align-items: center;
    gap: 2rem;
}

body .rating:nth-of-type(3) {
        align-self: flex-end;
}
```

### Continued development

It's time for my next step! I want to learn CSS Grid. I feel like I know Flexbox so it's time for Grid.  

Long term speaking, I want to (re-)learn JavaScript; Vue.js, nuxt.js and maybe other framworks.
